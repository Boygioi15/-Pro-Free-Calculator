## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
### Main idea
The main idea was we want to build a calculator that is suitable for multitask and yet still able to evaluate complicated expressions. On the market, there is casio simulator, but it cost money, and window calculator isn't able to compute complicated expression - thus Multi-calculator was born. 
### Functionalities
This project is a collaboration between me and Kiet Tran and it was done in our 3rd term
In this project, in short, we have done: 
 - Developed our own evaluating expression algorithm.
 - Used C# to build the calculator.
 - Use wix installer for packaging and deployment.

Our expression evaluation algorithm can: 
- Evaluate expression with operators and parentheses, like 3+2, 3+(2*5)/2...
- Evaluate expression with functions, like sin(3+2), log(sin(3+2),10)...
- Variable assignment, like sin(x) with x = 90. 

Main functionalities of our calculator: 
 - Functionalities : evaluating expression, work with matrix, solve equation with "n" variables. 
 - UI: Reponsiveness and light/dark theme
 - Deployment and packaging.
